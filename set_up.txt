How to set up Flask on Mac, as seen on https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-flask

All code should be run in the Terminal

Create a folder for your project:  
    mkdir LearnFlask

Move into this project folder:  
    cd LearnFlask

Set up the environment within the project folder, preferably with the same name:
    python3 -m venv myenv

Activate the environment:
    . myenv/bin/activate

Then install Flask in the project:
    pip install flask

After creating the .py file and coding the project, set FLASK_APP environment variable to the file name:
    export FLASK_APP=projectfilename.py

Activate debug mode, but only for development. Debug mode must be deactivated in production. There are two ways to activate debug mode:
1. Within the .py file in the editor (preferred):
    app.run(debug=True)
2. Within the terminal:
    export FLASK_DEBUG=True

Run flask:
    flask run

Copy the link created in the terminal and paste it in a browser to open the project on a local(development) server

Press CTRL C to quit running the project on the server

To deactivate Flask in the Terminal: 
    deactivate

Store the requirements in a text file, so that others can run the same code easily:
    pip freeze > requirements.txt

When installing a project gotten elsewhere, install its requirements before running Flask:
    pip install -r requirements.txt
